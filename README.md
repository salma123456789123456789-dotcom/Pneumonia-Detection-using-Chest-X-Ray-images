# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Chest-X-Ray-images
In this project, an efficient pneumonia detection model formed on digital x-ray images of the chest is proposed, which could help radiologists in their decision-making process. A new approach based on a weighted classifier is introduced, which combines the weighted predictions of advanced deep learning models such as ResNet50, Vgg16, Vgg19, DenseNet201 in an optimal way. This approach is a supervised learning approach in which the network predicts the outcome based on the quality of the data set used. Transfer learning is used to refine deep learning models to achieve higher training and validation accuracy.
